Chainer* is a Python*-based deep learning framework aiming at flexibility and intuition. It provides automatic differentiation APIs based on the define-by-run approach (a.k.a. dynamic computational graphs) as well as object-oriented high-level APIs to build and train neural networks. It supports various network architectures including feed-forward nets, convnets, recurrent nets and recursive nets. It also supports per-batch architectures. Forward computation can include any control flow statements of Python without lacking the ability of backpropagation. It makes code intuitive and easy to debug. Intel® optimization for Chainer, is currently integrated with the latest release of Intel® Math Kernel Library for Deep Neural Networks (Intel® MKL-DNN) 2017 optimized for Intel® Advanced Vector Extensions 2 (Intel® AVX) and Intel® Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (Intel®AVX-512) instructions which are supported in Intel® Xeon® and Intel® Xeon Phi™ processors.

## Recommended Environments
We recommend these Linux distributions.
- Ubuntu 14.04/16.04 LTS 64bit
- CentOS 7 64bit

The following versions of Python can be used: 
- 2.7.5+, 3.5.2+, and 3.6.0+

Above recommended environments are tested. We cannot guarantee that Intel® optimization for Chainer works on other environments including Windows* and macOS*, even if Intel optimization for Chainer looks to be running correctly.


## Install Chainer from source
You can use setup.py to install Chainer from the tarball:

```sh
$ python setup.py install
```
ideep4py has been splitted from Chainer, you need to install ideep4py:
```sh
$ pip install ideep4y
```
Use pip to uninstall chainer and ideep4py:

```sh
$ pip uninstall chainer ideep4py
```

## Training Examples

Training test with mnist dataset:
```sh
$ cd examples/mnist
$ python train_mnist.py -g -1
```

Training test with cifar datasets:
- run the CIFAR-100 dataset:
```sh
$ cd examples/cifar
$ python train_cifar.py –g -1 --dataset='cifar100'
```
- run the CIFAR-10 dataset:
```sh
$ cd examples/cifar
$ python train_cifar.py –g -1 --dataset='cifar10'
```
